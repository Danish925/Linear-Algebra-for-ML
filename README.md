# 📘 Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

This repository contains my **personal learning notes and Jupyter notebooks** while studying the **Linear Algebra concepts required for Machine Learning**.

The goal of this repo is to build **strong mathematical intuition** with **hands-on NumPy examples**, not heavy proofs.

---

## 🎯 Why this Repository?

Linear Algebra is the backbone of Machine Learning, but it is often taught in a very abstract way.  
In this repository, I focus on:

- Understanding concepts **intuitively**
- Connecting math directly to **Machine Learning**
- Learning through **experimentation in Jupyter notebooks**
- Keeping explanations **simple and beginner-friendly**

This repository documents my **learning journey** step by step.
